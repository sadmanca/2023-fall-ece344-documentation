# Lab 6: Filesystems

**Due: December 6 @ 11:59 PM**

In this lab you'll be making a 1 MiB `ext2` file system with 2
directories, 1 regular file, and 1 symbolic link.
You'll be given the `ext2` structures and some initial skeleton code
which creates a file called `hello.img` in the current working
directory.
You're expected to create a valid `ext2` filesystem.
See it's contents by mounting it with `sudo mount -o loop test.img mnt`.
After, when you run `ls -ain mnt/` you should get the following
(I omitted the fields that depend on your machine or date):

    total 7
          2 drwxr-xr-x 3    0    0 1024 .
                                        ..
          13 lrw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000   11 hello -> hello-world
          12 -rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000   12 hello-world
          11 drwxr-xr-x 2    0    0 1024 lost+found

This lab takes some time, so please *start early*.
Afterwards you will have experience with real file system internals.

## Setup

Ensure you're in the `ece344` directory within VSCode.
Make sure you have the latest skeleton code from us by running:
`git pull upstream main`.

This will create a merge, which you should be able to do cleanly.
If you don't know how to do this read [Pro Git][pro-git].
**Be sure to read chapter 3.1 and 3.2 fully.**
This is how software developers coordinate and work together in large projects.
For this course, you should always merge to maintain proper history between
yourself and the provided repository.
**You should never rebase in this course, and in general you should
never rebase unless you have a good reason to.**
It will be important to keep your code up-to-date during this lab as the
test cases may change with your help.

You can finally run: `cd hello-ext2` to begin the lab.

## Task

Using wrapped system calls, along with the provided `ext2` structures
you'll be creating a valid `ext2` filesystem image that the kernel
could mount.
You'll be connecting the dots and learning that filesystems, like everything
on your computer, are just a bunch of numbers with structure.
You should try not to hard code as much as possible.
I have set up defines for you to use for block numbers and inode numbers.
The root directory is always inode 2 for `2` is defined by `ext2`.
We'll be creating a 1 MiB `ext2` file system with 1 KiB sized blocks
and space for 128 inodes.
You'll be creating 4 inodes: the root directory, the `lost+found`
directory, a regular file named `hello-world`, and a symbolic link
named `hello` which points to `hello-world`.
You are provided with the inode for `lost+found` along with its
directory block.
The root directory and the `lost+found` should be owned by uid 0
and gid 0 (root).
The owner should have read, write, and execute permissions.
The group and other should have read and execute permissions.
The `hello-world` file and `hello` symlink should be
owned by uid 1000 and gid 1000 (typically the number of the first "normal"
user).
The owner should have read and write permissions.
The group and other should only have read permission.
Your `hello-world` file should only be 12 bytes long and contain
"Hello world" followed by a newline.

### Modifications

You'll be writing the following functions in
`hello-ext2/src/ext2-create.c`:

    write_superblock
    write_block_group_descriptor_table
    write_block_bitmap
    write_inode_bitmap
    write_inode_table
    write_root_dir_block
    write_hello_world_file_block

## Additional APIs

All the header files you'll need are included for you.
You should read and understand the macros.

## Starting

Run the following command to get the skeleton for Lab 6:
`git pull upstream main`.
You should be able to run the meson commands in the `hello-ext2`
directory (shown in the "Running" section) to
create a `build/ext2-create` executable.
When you run the executable it creates `hello.img` as described
at the beginning.
You can then run `fsck.ext2 hello.img`, and will likely be
asked to fix (many) errors.
At the end of this lab you're expected to have no errors after running
`fsck.ext2`.
In addition to the course materials, you'll find extra resources
<http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html> and
<http://www.science.smith.edu/~nhowe/262/oldlabs/ext2.html>.

You should also watch the help video I created:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCS5K0t9j38>

## Running

These are all the commands you'll likely want to use (minus the normal
clean command):

    meson setup build
    meson compile -C build
    build/ext2-create # run the executable to create hello.img
    sudo dumpe2fs hello.img # dumps the filesystem information to help debug
    sudo fsck.ext2 hello.img # this will check that your filesystem is correct
    mkdir mnt # create a directory to mnt your filesystem to
    sudo mount -o loop hello.img mnt  # mount your filesystem, loop uses a file
    sudo umount mnt # unmount the filesystem when you're done
    rmdir mnt # delete the directory used for mounting when you're done

You can find example output of both `dumpe2fs` and
`fsck.ext2` in the "Examples" section.
If you think it may be easier to read the binary of your filesystem, or
you're interested, you can use `hexdump -C hello.img`.

## Errors

For any wrapped system calls, you should check for errors.
If there is an error, you may exit with the error number (`errno`).
There is now an `errno_exit` macro to make your code more readable.

## Tips

This lab may be frustrating to start, as you won't have much to show for it.
However, after you're done with the superblock and your first inode, you'll
make progress much faster.
Note that the skeleton code creates a 1 MiB image file for you, which is
initialized to all zeros.
Also, when you assign `{0}` to a `struct` in C, it will
zero initialize it.
You should zero initialize everything.
Remember that blocks start from 0, and inodes start from 1.

## Testing

There are a set of basic test cases given to you (they'll be released a few
days after the lab).
We'll withhold more advanced tests which we'll use for grading.
Part of programming is coming up with tests yourself.
To run the provided test cases please run the following command in your lab
directory:

    sudo python -m unittest

## Grading

Run the `grade.py` script in the directory.
This will rebuild your program, run the tests, and give you a grade out of
100 based on your test results.
Note that these test cases may not be complete, more may be added before the
due date, or there may be hidden test cases.
These labs are new, so we may need to change.

## Submission

Simply push your code using `git push origin main` (or simply
`git push`) to submit it.
*You need to create your own commits to push, you can use as many
as you'd like.*
You'll need to use the `git add` and `git commit` commands.
Push as many commits as you want, your latest commit that modifies
the lab files counts as your submission.
For submission time we will *only* look at the timestamp on our server.
We will never use your commit times (or file access times) as proof of
submission, only when you push your code to the course Git server.

## Examples

### Output of `sudo dumpe2fs hello.img`

Note that your output may be slightly different. You should understand these
values and use macros that make sense, and not just hard code them.
However, you should get something like:
